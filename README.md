[Docs](https://docs.rs/tcp_typed/0.1.4)

A wrapper around platform TCP socket APIs that leverages the type system to ensure correct usage.

It's quite easy to accidentally misuse the Berkeley sockets or similar APIs, resulting in ECONNRESET/EPIPE/etc, data being lost on close, and potential hangs from non-exhaustive collection of events given edge-triggered notifications.

This library aims to make it impossible to misuse in non-unsafe code.

If you ever see a connection reset / ECONNRESET, EPIPE, data being lost on close, or panic, then it is a bug in this library! Please file an issue with as much info as possible.

It's designed to be used in conjunction with an implementer of the [`Notifier`](https://docs.rs/tcp_typed/0.1.4/tcp_typed/trait.Notifier.html) trait â€“ for example [`notifier`](https://github.com/alecmocatta/notifier). As long as the [`Notifier`](https://docs.rs/tcp_typed/0.1.4/tcp_typed/trait.Notifier.html) contract is fulfilled, then this library will collect all relevent events (connected, data in, data available to be written, remote closed, bytes acked, connection errors) upon each edge-triggered notification.

## Note

Currently doesn't support Windows.
