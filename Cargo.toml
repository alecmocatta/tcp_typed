description = """
A wrapper around platform TCP socket APIs that leverages the type system to ensure correct usage.

It's quite easy to accidentally misuse the Berkeley sockets or similar APIs, resulting in ECONNRESET/EPIPE/etc, data being lost on close, and potential hangs from non-exhaustive collection of edge-triggered events.

This library aims to make it impossible to misuse in non-unsafe code.
